# Reforger Base

**Reforger Base** is a shared system for my Garry's Mod addons under the [Reforger] tag.  
Its main purpose is to provide a unified damage and logic framework for different vehicle systems, such as:

- **LVS**
- **Simfphys** 
- **Glide Vehicles**

## Features

- Cross-framework damage handling
- Player damage simulation inside vehicles
- Easy hook integration for extending or overriding behavior

# Possibly Conflicting Addons

- [Damage Players In Seats](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428278317) (May increase damage to players in vehicle)
