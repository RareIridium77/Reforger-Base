# Reforger Base  
Reforger Base is a shared system for my Garry's Mod addons under the [Reforger] tag.  
Its main purpose is to provide a unified damage and logic framework for different vehicle systems, such as:

- **[LVS](https://github.com/SpaxscE/lvs_base)**
- **[Simfphys](https://github.com/SpaxscE/simfphys_base)** 
- **[Gmod Glide](https://github.com/StyledStrike/gmod-glide)**

## Potentially Conflicting Addons  
These addons may interfere with Reforger's damage logic and cause unintended behavior:  
- [Damage Players In Seats](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428278317)  
  _May apply additional damage to players inside vehicles. OR MAKE YOUR GAME CAUSE LAGS (JUST MY GUESS)_  
- [[LVS & Simfphys] Derby and more crash damage](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3327523626)  
  _May override or conflict with Reforger's collision damage system._
- [!*$%? ERRORS by Earu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1604765873)  
  _Brokes `reforger_base_entity` entity handling damage._

You can freely use and modify this base within your GMod projects, but attribution is appreciated.
